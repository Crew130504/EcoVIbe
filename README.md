## Project Overview

This project involves building a virtual second-hand clothing store, applying object-oriented programming principles, user interface design, and business logic.

- **Description:** The application enables users to register, list products, search for clothing items, add them to a cart, and make secure payments.
- **Features:**
  - User registration and authentication (Java Backend)
  - Product publication and image uploads (Python Backend)
  - Product search and selection
  - Purchase simulation with client references
  - Reviews and ratings system (planned)

## Technologies Used

### **Backend (Java)**
- **Java 11+**
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the Java backend.
- **Spring Security**: Handles user authentication and security.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.

### **Backend (Python)**
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework for building REST APIs.
- **Flask-CORS**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication.

### **Frontend**
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Handles dynamic content and API interactions.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Provides responsive design and pre-styled components.

### **Other Tools**
- **Virtual Environment (venv)**: For managing Python dependencies.
- **HTTP Server (Python)**: To serve static frontend files locally.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Java 11+** and **Maven** installed for the Java backend.
- **Python 3.8+** installed for the Python backend.
- A modern web browser to run the frontend.

### Running the Java Backend

1. Navigate to the Java backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd .\BackendJava\demo\
   ```
2. Build and run the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. The Java backend will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running the Python Backend

1. Navigate to the Python backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd BackendPython
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. The Python backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Start a simple HTTP server to serve the frontend files:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 5500
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Users can register and log in using the Java backend with Spring Security.
- **Product Management:** Users can upload product details and images via the Python backend using Flask.
- **Product Search:** Users can search for products by name.
- **Secure Transactions:** Simulated purchase functionality with client references.
- **Image Handling:** Images are uploaded and served dynamically from the Python backend.
- **Responsive Design:** The frontend is fully responsive using Bootstrap.
